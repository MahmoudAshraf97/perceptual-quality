  > https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06752

  Note that the code and trained models provided here are reimplementations of
  the models used in the paper. There may thus be minor performance
  discrepancies (we found them to have slightly worse performance on BAPPS-2AFC
  but better performance on BAPPS-JND).

  Args:
    model_name: String. Either "pim-1" or "pim-5" for 1 or 5 mixture components,
      respectively. For 1 component, the symmetrized KL divergence can be more
      easily evaluated because it collapses to the squared Euclidean distance.
    weights_cache: String. File path for caching model weights downloaded from
      web storage.

  Returns:
    Appropriately configured `PIM` instance ready to be used.
